# Hunters Guidelines

1. All quests have a set of rules and guidelines called Quest Instructions that hunters who join must follow in order to gain rewards. Makers have the right to reject submissions or deny to give rewards if the hunter has not met the rules and guidelines of the Quest.

2. Once you have submitted your proof, your submission will wait for moderation by the maker directly. This process may take anywhere from a few hours up to 72 hours. If the maker does not perform the moderation process (approve or reject your submission) within 72 hours from the submitted date, it will be automatically approved.

3. If you receive a rejection to your submission, you can appeal to change the moderation result if you think the reason for rejection is not valid. You can perform the appeal process via the ‘Appeal to the maker’ tab on the quest page. When you submit your message and click the Send Email button, your appeal message will be delivered to the maker’s registered email.

4. You will receive the quest reward in the form of USD Point 4 hours after your submission is approved by the maker. The reward will be distributed to your My Credit section on your Profile page. In that page, you can transfer your reward to the equal amount of HUNT tokens (a ERC20 based cryptocurrency) calculated by the market price at the point when you request to withdraw.

5. Do not submit non-relevant proofs to the quest instruction, plagiarise or fake your content, appeal to the maker without any valid appeal reasons, or interrupt the quest operation. If you do any of these things, we can blacklist your account. If blacklisted, you won't be able to receive Rewards from your Quest approval or withdraw the USD Point displayed on the My Credit section.

6. Makers can report your submission if they think it is an abusing attempt or your proof submission is far lower than the standard quality. If your account is reported multiple times, you will be banned from using Reviewhunt.

7. Please check carefully that you are qualified to run this quest. In each quest, there may be specific requirements that define which hunters can join the quest (e.g. device type, minimum number of followers of your social channel, language, etc.).

8. Reviewhunt runs a "Trust Score System", where the trust score acts as a measurable index that demonstrates how trustworthy a hunter is in relation to Reviewhunt activities. The score is calculated based on email verification, alt account operation, approval rate of submissions, and more. This score updates on a daily basis. You may be limited to join some quests if your Trust Score is lower than the required minimum score set by the maker for each quest.

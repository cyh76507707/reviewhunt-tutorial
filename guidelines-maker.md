# Makers Guidelines

## 1. Simple and Clear Quest Instructions
Please make simple and clear quest instructions and proof examples. You will approve/reject hunter’s submission based on what you have outlined in your quest instructions. We can reverse the moderation result if we receive a complaint from the hunter and the rejection reasons are not clear.

## 2. Adequate Quest Reward Level
Please set an adequate amount of quest reward per approved submission. If your set reward is too low compared to the level of accomplishment of the quest mission, hunters may not participate in your quest. Once you launch your quest, it is not possible to close your quest running until the quest budget has all been distributed.

## 3. Multiple Tasks in One Quest
Do not include multiple tasks in one quest. One quest should have only one task (or a number of steps to complete the task). Please note that your quest can be deleted if the team concludes that your quest has multiple different tasks altogether in one quest.

## 4. Reward Distribution
The quest reward will be distributed to the hunter 4 hours after you have approved the submission. Once the reward is distributed, you are not able to change the result.

## 5. Moderation within 72 Hours
You should moderate the hunter’s submissions within 72 hours from the submitted date. If you don’t approve/reject within this period, the quest submission will be automatically approved.

## 6. Quest Expiration
Your quest will expire when there is not sufficient budget to accept more hunters to join. In this case, you can top up your budget to keep the quest running. If not, your quest will automatically finish.

## 7. Moderation Appeal
You may receive a request via your registered email from a hunter whose submission got rejected in order to change your moderation result. You should respond to the appeal and reply with a fair reason for rejection. If your quest instructions do not clearly address the reason for the rejection, you need to change the moderation result to approved.

## 8. Achievable Quest
Your quest must be achievable by any hunters based on your quest instructions. If we find out that your quest is designed in such a way that makes it impossible to achieve, we can approve hunter submissions without your permission (if the hunters have used their time and resources to perform your quest, but failed because it’s too difficult to understand based on your instructions or physically impossible to achieve). We can also stop running quests that are designed to abuse hunters labor.

## 9. Illegal Quest
We can refuse to run any quests that are related to areas considered illegal in some countries, such as gambling, scams, Ponzi schemes, malware, phishing, illegal drugs, etc.

## 10. Request Refund
When you request a refund, a daily deduction will be applied to your refundable amount to prevent a quest running too long in a low quality way. Your refundable amount will be calculated based on the “Remaining Balance” minus the daily deduction, which is calculated by 1/30th each day. For more details, please read the [Refund Policy](https://review.hunt.town/refund-policy).
